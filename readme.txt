# Experiment setup:
FS-Mol (features), and ADKF-IFT (task split)

# Method:
ProtoNet (protonet) , later: NeuralSimilaritySearch (generalized framework),
knn lookup (boosting drug target afffinity)

# Scientific question:
Is it possible to boost the performance of few-shot methods by enriching molecule representation with knn lookups

# Practical work: Qualitive (1 method, 1 dataset)

# Master thesis: Quanititave (set of methods, set of datasets)
